# AutonomousRacecar
## Background: 
The Autonomous Vehicle Project is a project advised by an UC Irvine EECS professor and is now taken over by me and two other UCI EECS undergraduate students as our senior design project. Our goal is to build an autonomous racecar with improved software from the previous team working on this project before us following instructions from the F1Tenth Autonomous Racing Competition (http://f1tenth.org/).
